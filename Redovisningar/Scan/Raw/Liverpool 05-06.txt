Directors Report

The Directors submit their report and audited accounts of The Liverpool
Football Club and Athletic Grounds Pic for the year ended 31 July 2006.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities

Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or
loss of the company for that period. In preparing those
financial statements, the Directors are required to:

« select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;

* make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;

* state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any materiai departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;

* prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.

The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonabie accuracy at any time
the financial pesition of the company and enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Directors’
Report and other information included in the Annual Report is

prepared in accordance with company law in the United Kingdom,

The Directors intend to publish these accounts on the website
www liverpoolfc.tv. The maintenance and integrity of this
website is the responsibility of the Directors.

Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Subsidiary undertakings and joint venture
Details of the company’s subsidiary undertakings and jaint
venture are set out in note 13 to the accounts.

Results and dividend

The profit and loss account on page 24 shows a loss after
taxation for the year of €4,257,000 (2005: profit £7,533,000).
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend
and the retained loss for the year of £4,257,000 has been
deducted from reserves.

Review of the business

The principal activities of the company continued to be
those of a professional football club and related activities.
A review of the company’s business is contained in the
Business Review and the Financial Highlights. Future

developments are outlined in the Business Review on page 18.

Financial instruments

An explanation of the company's exposure to price risk, credit
risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk is set aut below. The
company's financial instruments comprise bank balances and
cash together with various net working capital items which arise
directly from its operations such as trade debtors and trade
creditors. The main purpase of these financial instruments is to
transact and to raise finance for the company’s operations.

* Currency
Where currencies other than sterling are used, the
company takes necessary hedging to ensure exposure
to risk is carefully managed.

* Credit risk
Exposure is spread over a large number of customers
minimising any concentration of risk in one area.

+ Interest rate
The company has a policy of insuring against any future
interest rate increases.

* Liquidity risk
Financial risk is managed in such a way as to ensure
there is always sufficient liquidity available.

Land and buildings

[In the opinion of the Directors a comparison between cost
and market value of freehold and long leasehold land and
buildings is of no reat significance in the context of the
company's operations.

Payment policy to creditors
With respect to the immediately following accounting period in
relation to all its suppliers, it is the company’s policy:

(i} to settle the terms of payment with those suppliers when
agreeing the terms of each transaction;

(ii) to ensure that these suppliers are made aware of the
terms of payment; and

(iii) to abide by the terms of payment.

Trade creditors at 31 July 2006 represented 24 days of annual
purchases (2005 - 24 days]. This figure excludes creditors in
respect of player acquisitions for which payment is made on
the date itis contractually due.

Employees

Within the bounds of commercial confidentiality, the company
endeavours to keep staff at all levels informed of matters
that affect the progress of the company and are of interest to
them as employees.

The company operates an equal opportunities policy.

The aim of this policy is to ensure that there should be equal
opportunity for all and this applies to external recruitment,
internal appointments, terms of employment, conditions of

 
 

 

service and opportunity for training and promotion regardless
of gender, ethnic origin or disability.

Disabled persons are given full and fair consideration for all
types of vacancy in as much as the opportunities available are
constrained by the practical limitations of the disability. Should,
for whatever reason, an employee of the company become
disabled whilst in employment, every step, where appropriate
will be taken to assist with rehabilitation and suitable re-training.
The company maintains its own health, safety and environmental
policies covering all aspects of its operations,

Regular meetings and inspections take place to ensure all
legal requirements are adhered to and that the cornpany is
responsive to the needs of the employees and the environment.

recommended in the Combined Code on Corporate

Notes to the Accounts C7

for the year ended 31 July 2006

 

1. Accounting policies

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are as follows.

1.1 Basis of accounting

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with applicable
accounting standards. Group accounts consolidating the accounts of The Liverpool Football Club and Athletic Grounds Ple
and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 July 20046 have not been prepared. These accounts present
information about the company as an individual undertaking and not about its group. Information relating to the
company’s joint venture investment is shown separately in note 13. The company's share of the joint venture's operating
profit is excluded from the company’s own operating loss as the company is not required to prepare consolidated accounts.

1.2 Turnover and income recognition

Turnover represents income receivable from the company’s principal activities and is exclusive of value added tax and
transfer fees, Matchday receipts are stated after percentage payments to The Football Association, The Football League
and visiting clubs. Revenue from this source is recognised over the course of the football season as games are played.
Sponsorship and similar commercial income is recognised over the duration of the respective contracts. Income arising
from the fixed element of broadcasting revenue is recognised aver the duration of the playing season. Facility fees which
relate to live coverage or highlights of games are recognised as earned. Revenue arising from participation in European
competitions is recognised as matches are played and is classified as matchday income and media income as appropriate.

1.3 Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on the cost of fixed assets appropriate to their estimated useful lives as follows

Freehold/long leasehold buildings ................ 2% Fixtures, fittings and equipment.............. 10%
Youth Acad@my .. 0.0. cece eee eee eee 2% Motor vehicles 2.002... 00 cc ccc eee eens 20%
Training Ground ........ 0... ceca cece eee 2% Computers ..... 0c ee cece eee eee eee eee 25%

Freehold and long leasehold land is not depreciated, Costs in connection with the new stadium project have not been
depreciated. All other classes of tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at the rates stated above,
except for fixtures, fittings and equipment which are depreciated on the reducing balance method. The historical cost of
the existing stadium is included under the heading “stands, fixtures, fittings and equipment” shown in note 11.

The useful economic life of the existing stadium has been reviewed. This has been revised to 4 years including the year
under review. The difference between its carrying value and the expected residual value will be provided for ona
straight-line basis aver the revised useful economic life. The depreciation charge for the year in relation to the existing
stadium has been reduced by £654,250 as a result of this change.

1.4 Intangible fixed assets

The costs associated with the acquisition of players’ registrations are capitalised as intangible fixed assets. These costs
are fully amortised in equal instalments over the period of players’ initial contracts. Where a player's contract is
extended beyond its initral period, amortisation is calculated over the period of the extended contract from the date on
which it is signed. Players’ registrations are written down for impairment when the carrying amount exceeds the
amount recoverable through use or sale.

1.5 Signing on fees
In the opinion of the Directors, signing on fees are a normal part of a player's employment cost. Consequently, signing
on fees are charged to the profit and loss account in the accounting period in which they are paid.

1.6 Stock
Stock represents goods for resale and is valued at the Lower of invoice cost and net realisable value.

1.7 Finance leases, operating leases and hire purchase

Assets acquired under finance leases or hire purchase contracts are treated as tangible fixed assets and depreciation is
provided accordingly. The present value of future rentals is shown as a liability and the interest element of rental
obligations is charged ta the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight-line basis. Operating lease
rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

1.8 Deferred taxation

Full provision is made for deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from differences between the recognition of gains
and losses in the financial statements and their recognition for tax purposes. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all
timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-
discounted basis.

1.9 Pensions

The company operates its own contributory defined contribution scheme which is managed by Norwich Union.

In addition, certain employees are members of The Football League Players’ Retirement Income Scheme or

The Footbatl League Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme. Contributions are also paid to individuals’ private
pension schemes. Pension contributions are charged te the profit and loss account as they become payable.

The company continues te make contributions in respect of its share of the deficit of the defined benefit section of

The Football League Limited Pension and Life Assurance Scheme [the ‘Scherme’]. Accrual of benefits on a final salary
basis was suspended with effect from 31st August 1799, when an actuarial review showed a substantial deficit.

As one of a number of participating employers the company is advised only of its share of the Scheme’s deficit.

[ts share of the underlying assets and Liabilities of the Scheme cannot be identified on a reasonable and consistent basis.
Therefore, ne disclosures are made under the provisions of FRS17, Retirement Benefits.

1.10 Deferred credits
Deferred credits relate to grants receivable from The Football Trust in relation to stadium improvements. These are
transferred to the profit and loss account over the life of the assets to which the grants relate. Grants are repayable to
The Football Trust in certain exceptional circumstances. In the opinion of the Directors such circumstances are untikely
to arise in the course of the company’s normal operations.
1.11 Foreign currency transactions
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange approximating to those ruling
at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date
are translated at the rates ruling as at that date. Translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.

Fees for other non-audit services in 2004 consist principally of charges regarding corporate taxation, VAT
and company secretarial matters.

In the apinion of the Directors, certain expenditure relating to the cost of acquiring player registrations previously
included in administrative expenses is more appropriately classified within profit/loss on player registrations. The effect
of this reclassification is to reduce the profit on player registrations in 2005 by £2,108,000 and reduce administrative
expenses by the same amount.

There has also been a reclassification of travel and gate expenses from cost of sales to administrative expenses.
The net effect of this reclassification is ta reduce cost of sales in 2005 by £3,260,000 and increase administrative expenses
by the same amount.
