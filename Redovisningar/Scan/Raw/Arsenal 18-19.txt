STRATEGIC REPORT

The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 May 2019.

Principal Activity and Strategy

The principal activity of the Group is that of a professional football club playing in the Premier League. The Group
is also engaged in a number of property developments.

The Board’s long term strategy is to continue to develop Arsenal Football Club as a leading club on both the
domestic and global stages. The Board are committed to a business model which invests the funds generated by the
business back into the Club with the aim of achieving an increased level of on-field success with the ultimate goal of
winning trophies and using that on-field success to increase the Club’s engaged worldwide fan base.

Results for the year
The loss for the year after taxation was £27.1 million (2018 — profit of £56.6 million),
Review of the business

The result for the year can be broken down into the following key components:-

2019 2018
£m £m
Operating profit before exceptional costs and player trading 73.0 75.4
Exceptional costs (3.9) (17.2)
Amortisation and impairment of player registrations (91.0) (91.8)
Sale of player registrations / Loan of players 16.8 122.3
Property trading profits 0.3 5.3
Net interest costs (12.0) (8.8)
Other (15.4) (15.0)
(Loss)/profit before tax (32.2) 70.2

Football Revenue for the year was £394.7 million (2018 - £388.2 million) with the increase being mainly
attributable to the Club reaching the final of the UEFA Europa League (2018 — reached semi-final) together with
increased commercial revenues which included the Visit Rwanda sleeve partnership as a new category. Overall
operating profits were impacted by continued investment in player wages which meant that total staff costs,
excluding exceptional costs, grew by £8.4 million to £231.7 million (2018 - £223.3 million).

The exceptional costs incurred of £3.9 million (2018 - £17.2 million) were attributable to a number of changes in the
First Team coaching and support personnel and transaction advisory costs incurred by the Company in relation to
KSE UK Inc becoming the Group’s sole shareholder.

After a high level of activity in the prior year, player trading activity for 2019/20 was fairly limited. The total profit
on sale of player registrations was £12.2 million (2018 - £120.0 million) and player loans amounted to £4.6 million
(2018 - £2.3 million). Player trading profits have a significant impact on overall profitability particularly where
other operating profits are adversely impacted by participation in the UEFA Europa League as opposed to the more
lucrative UEFA Champions League. Average annual profits on sale of player registrations over the last five years,
including 2019/20, have been £34.0 million.

During the year there was limited activity in the Group’s property development business.

Net interest costs were impacted by a negative movement of £0.7 million (2018 - £3.3 million positive) in the
market value of the Group’s Stadium Finance interest rate swap.
ARSENAL HOLDINGS LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT

Balance Sheet

Following additions to player registrations at a cost of £99.0 million and amortisation charges, the book value of
intangible fixed assets (player registrations) was increased to £2403 million (2018 - £238.2 million).

The year end cash position, despite the delay of season ticket renewals into June as a result of the UEFA Europa
League final, was robust with balances of £167.0 million (2018 - £231.3 million), The levels of debtors and
creditors were influenced by the Club’s transfer activity, both inbound and outbound, with instalments of the
transfer fees being payable and receivable over time and mainly over the next two years.

Key performance indicators
Non- financial:

° Premier League 5" place (qualified for UEFA Europa League 2019/20) against a target of continued
qualification for the UEFA Champions League;

e UEFA Europa League finalists;

® Ticket sales versus capacity (average ticket sales over 30 home games were 58,943 against 58,012 over 30
home fixtures in the previous season).

Financial

e Revenue;

e Payroll costs;

® Operating profits/EBITDA (before player trading);

° Player trading (acquisitions/sales);

° Property profits;

° Cash flow;

® Compliance with applicable financial regulations including UEFA Financial Fair Play (FFP);
© Compliance with Stadium Finance bonds financial covenants.

Quantitative disclosures in respect of financial key performance indicators are included in the financial statements.

Risks and uncertainties

There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term
performance. The Board meets regularly during the year, either by telephone or on a face to face basis, and
monitors these risks on a continual basis. In addition, the management of day to day operational risk is delegated to
the Group Executive (the senior management team and executive directors).

The key business risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are considered to relate to:

° the performance and popularity of the first team;

° the recruitment and retention of key employees;

° the rules and regulations of the applicable football governing bodies;

° the negotiation and pricing of broadcasting contracts,

® the rates of UK taxation applicable to the Group and its key employees; and
° the renewal of key commercial agreements on similar or improved terms.

The Group’s income is affected by the performance and popularity of the first team and significant sources of
revenue are derived from strong performances in the Premier League and UEFA European competitions. The
Group seeks to maintain playing success by continually investing in the development of its playing squad and it
ARSENAL HOLDINGS LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT

enters into employment contracts with each of its key personnel with a view to securing their services for the term of
the contract. However, the Group operates in a highly competitive market in both domestic and European
competition and retention of personnel cannot be guaranteed. In addition, the activities of the Group’s main
competitors can determine trends in the market rates for transfers and wages that the Group may be required to
follow in order to maintain the strength of its first team squad.

The Club is regulated by the rules of the FA, Premier League, UEFA and FIFA. Any change to FA, Premier
League, UEFA and FIFA regulations in the future could have an impact on the Group as the regulations cover areas
such as: the format of competitions, FFP, the division of broadcasting income, the eligibility of players and the
operation of the transfer market.

The Group monitors its compliance with all applicable rules and regulations on a continuous basis and also monitors
and considers the impact of any potential changes.

Broadcasting and certain other revenues are derived from contracts which are currently centrally negotiated by the
Premier League and, in respect of European competition, by UEFA; the Group does not have any direct influence,
alone, on the outcome of the relevant contract negotiations. The Premier League has secured TV rights sales for the
three year cycle, ending season 2021/22, with certain overseas rights already secured for a longer term.

The Group derives a material amount of revenue from sponsorship and other commercial relationships. The
underlying commercial agreements have finite terms and, whilst the Group fully expects that the global appeal of its
brand will allow its commercial revenues to grow strongly in the medium term, the renewal of existing contracts and
/ or acquisition of new partnerships cannot be guaranteed.

The Group is monitoring the impact of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union together with the possible
associated consequences. This has seen the value of sterling remain weak against the Euro; on the one hand
increasing the cost of player transfers from the EU and, on the other, increasing the sterling value of player sales to
the EU and European competition distributions paid out to clubs by UEFA in Euros. The most significant risk to the
Group would appear to be a downturn to the UK or wider economy impacting ticket revenues and / or the value of
broadcasting and / or sponsorship rights. Any potential impact on the recruitment and/or retention of players is also
being monitored closely.

The Group’s financial performance has previously remained reasonably immune to recessionary economic
conditions.

The Group has appropriate policies in place to manage its obligations with regard to employment law and employee
matters, environmental issues, anti-corruption / anti-bribery and social matters (including modern slavery and
human rights), but does not consider that these are areas of significant strategic risk to its operations.

Future developments

The Club will participate in the UEFA Europa League for season 2019/20 and has continued to invest strongly in
transfers over the 2019 summer window making a number of key player acquisitions. The Club has also invested
further in its player wage bill.

The Club’s renewed partnership with Emirates commences for season 2019/20 as does the new kit supplier
partnership with Adidas and this means the Club will report increased commercial revenues.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 May 2019.

Principal activities

The principal activity of the Group is that of a professional football club playing in the Premier League. The Group
is also engaged in a number of property developments associated with its relocation to the Emirates Stadium. The
Company was re-registered as a private company on 5 October 2018.

Profits and dividends

The results for the year are set out on page 11. The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend for the
year (2018 - £Nil).

Financial risk management

The Group’s operations are exposed to a variety of financial risks that include credit risk, currency risk and the risks
associated with liquidity and interest rates. The Group uses financial derivatives, in line with policies approved by
the Board, to manage these risks. The Group does not use financial derivatives for speculative purposes.

The Group enters into a number of transactions, relating mainly to its participation in European competition and
player transfers, which create exposure to movements in foreign exchange. The Group monitors this foreign
exchange exposure on a continuous basis and will usually hedge any significant exposure in its currency receivables

and payables.

The Group’s policy is to eliminate, as far as possible, all of the interest rate risk which arises from its outstanding
debt finance balances. Where debt balances are subject to floating rates of interest the Group will usually enter into
interest rate swaps which serve to fix the rate of interest.

The Group monitors its compliance with the applicable terms of its stadium debt finance arrangements on a
continuous basis and regularly reviews its forecast cash flow to ensure that it holds an appropriate level of bank
funds at all times including the required debt service reserves.

Credit checks and other appropriate financial due diligence are performed prior to the Group entering into new
material contracts.

The Club continues to be fully compliant with the Financial Fair Play regulations put in place by UEFA and the
Premier League.

Future developments
Details of future developments can be found in the Strategic Report.
Events after the Balance Sheet Date

Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are included in note 27 to the financial statements.

Going concern

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the annual financial statements.

The directors of the company, all of whom served throughout the year, are set out below:

Sir Chips Keswick

K.J. Friar OBE

Lord Harris of Peckham
E.S. Kroenke

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Directors’ Indemnities

The Group has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its directors, which were made
during the year and remain in force at the date of this report.

Employees

Within the bounds of commercial confidentiality, the Group endeavours to keep staff at all levels informed of
matters that affect the progress of the Group and are of interest to them as employees,

The Group operates an equal opportunities policy. The aim of this policy is to ensure that there should be equal
opportunity for all and this applies to external recruitment, internal appointments, terms of employment, conditions
of service and opportunity for training and promotion regardless of gender, ethnic origin or disability.

Disabled persons are given full and fair consideration for all types of vacancy in as much as the opportunities
available are constrained by the practical limitations of the disability. Should, for whatever reason, an employee of
the Group become disabled whilst in employment, every step, where appropriate will be taken to assist with
rehabilitation and suitable retraining.

The Group maintains its own health, safety and environmental policies covering all aspects of its operations.
Regular meetings and inspections take place to ensure all legal requirements are adhered to and that the Group is
responsive to the needs of its employees and the environment.

Auditors

In the case of each of the persons who are directors of the Company at the date when this report was approved:

© So far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is
unaware; and

e Each of the directors has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware of
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies
Act 2006.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT

Directors’ responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable
law), including FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the Uk and Republic of Ireland”, Under
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:

e select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
e make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

e state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and

e prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company and the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARSENAL
HOLDINGS LIMITED

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements of Arsenal Holdings Limited (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the
‘eroup’):

e give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 May 2019
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

e have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice,
including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland”; and

e have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:
e the consolidated profit and loss account;
e the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
e the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
e the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
e the consolidated cash flow statement;
e the related notes | to 27.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the
‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.

Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
e the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or
e the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may
cast significant doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARSENAL
HOLDINGS LIMITED (continued)

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we

have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent
company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website
at: www.fre.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
e the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
e the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the
directors’ report.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ARSENAL
HOLDINGS LIMITED (continued)

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report in respect of the following matters if, in our opinion:
e adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
e the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
© certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
e we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

1. Accounting policies

The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout
the year and to the preceding year.

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

General information and basis of accounting

Arsenal Holdings Limited is a private company limited by shares and registered in England and Wales
under the Companies Act. The address of the registered office is given on page 1. The nature of the
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the strategic report on pages 2 to 4.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include
certain items at fair value, and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102) issued
by the Financial Reporting Council.

The functional currency of Arsenal Holdings Limited is considered to be pounds sterling because that
is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. The consolidated
financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Foreign operations are included in accordance
with the policies set out below.

Basis of preparation of Group financial statements

The Group financial statements consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of the Company and its
subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 May 2019. All intra-group transactions, balances, incomes and
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the profit and loss account of the parent
company is not presented as part of these financial statements. The parent company is exempt from
the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement.

Going concern

The Group currently meets its day to day working capital requirements through its own financial
resources and has no reliance on bank facilities.

The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading
performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current financial
resources and bank facilities. The Group’s unused bank facilities are not currently due for renewal,
however, the Group has held discussions with its bankers about these facilities and no matters have
been drawn to its attention to suggest that renewal may not be forthcoming on acceptable terms.

The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

Joint venture and subsidiary undertakings

The joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and
which is jointly controlled by the Group, which holds 50% of the voting rights, and KSE UK Ine
under a contractual arrangement.

The Group’s share of the results of the joint venture are included in the consolidated profit and loss
account on the basis of audited financial statements. The Group’s share of the results and net assets of
the joint venture is included under the gross equity method and stated after adjustment to eliminate the
Group’s share of profits resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint venture which are
included in the carrying amount of assets reported in the joint venture’s balance sheet.

Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included in the Company’s financial statements at cost less
provisions for impairment.

Turnover and income recognition

Turnover represents income receivable, net of VAT, from football and related commercial activities
and income from the sale of development properties completed in the year. The Group has two
classes of business - the principal activity of operating a professional football club and property
development - both businesses are carried out principally within the United Kingdom.

Gate, match and other event day revenue is recognised over the period of the football season as games
are played and events are staged. Sponsorship and similar commercial income is recognised over the
duration of the respective contracts. The fixed element of broadcasting revenues is recognised over
the duration of the football season whilst facility fees for live coverage or highlights are taken when
earned at the point of broadcast. Merit awards are accounted for only when known at the end of the
financial period. UEFA pool distributions relating to participation in the Europa League are spread
over the matches played in the competition whilst distributions relating to match performance are
taken when earned; these distributions are classified as broadcasting revenues. Fees receivable in
respect of the loan of players are included in turnover over the period of the loan.

Turnover is recognised in respect of barter transactions only where services are exchanged for
dissimilar services and the transaction is deemed to have commercial substance. Such transactions are
measured at the fair value of the services received, adjusted by any amount of cash and cash
equivalents transferred.

Income from the sale of development properties is recognised on completion of the relevant sale
contract. Where elements of the sale price are subject to retentions by the purchaser the retained
element of the sale price is not recognised until such time as all of the conditions relating to the
retention have been satisfied.

Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Depreciation is calculated to reduce the carrying value of buildings, plant, equipment and motor
vehicles to the anticipated residual value of the assets concerned in equal annual instalments over their
estimated useful lives as follows:

Freehold buildings 2% per annum
Leasehold properties over the period of the lease
Plant and equipment 5% to 25% per annum

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Finance costs
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the debt using the
effective interest method.

Any non-current assets, e.g. player registrations, acquired on deferred terms are recorded at the
discounted present value at the date of acquisition. The associated payable is then increased to the
settlement value over the period of deferral, with this value being charged as a notional finance cost
through the profit and loss account.

Similarly any intangible asset disposed of on deferred terms will be initially recorded at the
discounted present value of future receipts and the receivable is then increased to the settlement value
over the period of deferral with this value being charged as notional finance income through the profit
and loss account.

Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument and are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into.

i: Financial liabilities

Basic financial instruments (including the stadium finance bonds and the C and D debentures) are
measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate
which exactly discounts the estimated future payments of receipts over the life of the instrument to its
carrying amount at initial recognition, re-estimated periodically to reflect changes in the market rate of
interest.

Non basic financial instruments (including the A and B debentures) are recognised at fair value, and
measured at the present value of the future payments, discounted at a market rate of interest. Any
periodic changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account.

Financial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged,
cancelled or expires.

ii. Derivative financial instruments

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange risk and
interest rate movements. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is
recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the
hedge relationship.

Stock
Stock comprises retail merchandise and development property for onward sale and is stated at the
lower of cost and net realisable value.

Where properties which are intended to be sold have been acquired they have been included in stock
as development properties. Development property comprises freehold land inclusive of the direct cost
of acquisition and other directly attributable property development costs including interest costs.

Grants

Grants received in respect of tangible fixed assets are credited to the profit and loss account over the
expected useful economic lives of the assets to which they relate. Grants received but not yet released
to the profit and loss account are included in the balance sheet as deferred income.

Other grants are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.

Player costs

The costs associated with acquiring players’ registrations or extending their contracts, including
agents’ fees, are capitalised and amortised, in equal instalments, over the period of the respective
players’ contracts. Where a contract life is renegotiated the unamortised costs, together with the new
costs relating to the contract extension, are amortised over the term of the new contract. Where the
acquisition of a player registration involves a non-cash consideration, such as an exchange for another
player registration, the transaction is accounted for using an estimate of the market value for the non-
cash consideration.

Under the conditions of certain transfer agreements or contract renegotiations, further fees will be
payable in the event of the players concerned making a certain number of First Team appearances or
on the occurrence of certain other specified future events. Liabilities in respect of these additional
fees are accounted for, as provisions, when it becomes probable that the number of appearances will
be achieved or the specified future events will occur. The additional costs are capitalised and
amortised as set out above.

(q)

Profits or losses on the sale of players represent the transfer fee receivable, net of any transaction
costs, less the unamortised cost of the applicable player’s registration.

Remuneration of players is charged in accordance with the terms of the applicable contractual
arrangements and any discretionary bonuses when there is a legal or constructive obligation.

Impairment

The Group will perform an impairment review on player registrations if adverse events indicate that
the amortised carrying value of its intangible assets may not be recoverable. Whilst no individual
player can be separated from the income generating unit, which is represented by the playing squad
and the football operations of the Group as a whole, there may be certain circumstances where a
player is taken out of the income generating unit. Such circumstances might include a player being
excluded from the playing squad due to sustaining a career threatening injury or where a permanent
fall out with senior football management means it is highly unlikely a particular player will ever play
for the club again. If such circumstances were to arise and be considered permanent, then the carrying
value of the player would be assessed against the Group’s best estimate of the player’s fair value less
any costs to sell and, if necessary, a provision would be made.

The Group’s assessment of fair value will be based on:-

e in the case of a player who has suffered a career threatening injury, the value attributed by the
Group’s insurers; or

e in the case of a player who has fallen out with senior football management, either the agreed
selling price in the event the player has been transferred since the year end or, if the player
has not been sold, the Group’s best estimation of disposal value taking into account recent
player disposals by both the Group and other clubs.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding
the obligation.

Foreign currencies

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held at the year end are translated at
year-end exchange rates. Exchange gains or losses are dealt with in the profit and loss account.

The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and
their balance sheets at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on
translation of the opening net assets and results of overseas operations are reported in other
comprehensive income.

Deferred income
Deferred income represents income from sponsorship agreements and other contractual agreements
which will be credited to the profit and loss account over the period of the agreements, season ticket
renewals for the 2019/20 season and advance income from executive boxes and Club Tier seats at
Emirates Stadium.

Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account evenly over the lease
period.

Pensions

The Group makes contributions on behalf of employees and directors to a number of independently
controlled defined contribution and money purchase schemes including The Football League Pension
and Life Assurance Scheme (the “Scheme”). Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account
over the period to which they relate.

18
ARSENAL HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
For the year ended 31 May 2019

In addition the Group is making contributions in respect of its share of the deficit of the defined
benefit section of The Football League Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (the “Scheme”). A
provision has been established for the Group’s share of the deficit which exists in this section of the
Scheme and this additional contribution is being charged to the profit and loss account over the
remaining service life of those Arsenal employees who are members of the Scheme. The amount
attributable to employees who have already retired or who have left the Group has been charged to the
profit and loss account.

Under the provisions of FRS 102 Section 28 the Scheme would be treated as a defined benefit multi-
employer scheme. The Scheme’s actuary has advised that the participating employers’ share of the
underlying assets and liabilities cannot be identified on a reasonable and consistent basis and
accordingly no disclosures are made under the provisions of FRS 102 Section 28.

The assets of all schemes are held in funds independent from the Group.

(r) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered)
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at
the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the
future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing
differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different
from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.

Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the
timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or sub-
stantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it can be regarded as
more likely than not that the reversal of underlying timing differences will result in a reduction in
future tax payments.

(s) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, representing the excess of the fair
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is
capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is considered to
be five years. Provision is made for any impairment.

Critical accounting judgements and estimates

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the directors are required to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered
to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s Accounting Policies

There were no critical judgements apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with separately
below, which the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and which
would have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

Provisions and contingent liabilities for player transactions

Creditors and provisions contain allowances for certain contingent amounts payable to players and to other
clubs based on management’s best estimate of certain future events, such as the number of player
appearances, and the amount that will become payable as a result. Actual future costs may differ from the
amounts provided.

19
ARSENAL HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
For the year ended 31 May 2019

Property trading stocks
The directors consider that the net realisable value of the Group’s property development stocks, making an
appropriate allowance for costs to complete, is greater than their book value.

Current taxation

The complex nature of tax legislation under which the Group operates necessitates the use of estimates and
assumptions in assessing the tax amounts provided in the financial statements. Actual tax payable may differ
from the amounts provided.

Tangible assets (continued)

At 31 May 2019 the Group had contracted capital commitments of £5.4 million (2018 - £8.2 million). The
cost of fixed assets includes £38.6 million of interest costs which were incurred on the stadium financing
bank facilities during the periods when Emirates Stadium was under construction. The capitalisation of
interest ceased in 2006 when Emirates Stadium came into use.

The figures for cost of player registrations are historic figures for the costs associated with acquiring players’
registrations or extending their contracts. Accordingly, the net book amount of player registrations will not
reflect, nor is it intended to, the current market value of these players nor does it take any account of players
developed through the Group’s youth system.

The directors consider the net realisable value of intangible assets to be significantly greater than their book
value.

The Group is required under the terms of its fixed rate bonds and floating rate bonds to maintain specified
amounts on bank deposit as security against future payments of interest and principal. Accordingly the use of
these debt service reserve accounts is restricted to that purpose. The Group uses short-term bank treasury
deposits as a means of maximising the interest earned on its cash balances.

The floating rate bonds bear interest at LIBOR for three month deposits plus a margin of 0.55% (2018 —
0.55%) and the Group has entered into interest rate swaps which fix the LIBOR element of this cost at

5.75%.

The costs of raising debt finance, in the form of fixed and floating rate bonds, are amortised to the profit and
loss account over the term of the bonds. The amortisation charge for the year was £480,000 (2018 -

£504,000).

The fixed rate bonds and floating rate bonds are guaranteed as to scheduled payments of principal and
interest by certain members of the Group and by Ambac Assurance UK Limited. The Group pays Ambac
Assurance UK Limited annual guarantee fees at a rate of 0.65% of fixed rate bond principal outstanding and
0.65% of the floating rate bond principal outstanding.

The Group’s fixed rate bonds and floating rate bonds are secured by a mixture of legal mortgages and fixed
charges on certain freehold and leasehold property and certain plant and machinery owned by the Group, by
fixed charges over certain of the Group’s trade debtors, by fixed charges over £54.5 million (2018 - £59.1
million) of the Group’s bank deposits, by legal mortgages or fixed charges over the share capital and
intellectual property rights of certain subsidiary companies and fixed and floating charges over the other
assets of certain subsidiary companies.

The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined by reference to the market price at the reporting date.
The Group’s cash and bank deposits earn interest at rates linked to LIBOR. The Group’s other financial
assets do not earn interest. Total interest income for the year is shown in note 5.

The interest rates attaching the Group’s fixed rate bonds, floating rate bonds and debentures are detailed in
note 16. The Group’s other financial liabilities do not attract interest. The cost for the year of the Group’s

Interest rate risk

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because part of its long-term debt is at floating rates of interest.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps the purpose of which is to minimise its exposure to this
interest rate risk.

Foreign currency management
The Group is mainly exposed to the foreign currencies of the Euro and US dollar.

Euros and £1.6 million (2018 - £2.6 million) denominated in US dollars.
